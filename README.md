A Transmaterial Body
2018

By Chelsea Thompto

New Media Performance

Debuted in Berlin, October 2018.

A Transmaterial Body consists of a mobile network created by a small linux machine, broadcasting a wireless signal 
creating a localized intranet wireless network. This network is battery powered and carried on Chelsea at all times. 
As such, the network and herself are constantly centered on and overlapping with each other.

Users who connect to this network will find their device's web browsers redirecting them to a web page accessible to 
them only while on the network that contains live streamed biological data, selected texts (including source material 
for recreating this project), and other media. In this work, prefix trans- is a tactic and gesture employed to explore 
and expand the boundaries of the corporeal self.

Note: This repository currently contains only the python, node.js, and .html code for the main webiste of the project,
setting files for other programs used will be added in the future.
